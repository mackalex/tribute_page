        <h3 id="headline">Here's a look at Martin Shkreli's life, and how he got to where he is today:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>'83</strong> - Born in Coney Island Hospital to Albanian and Croatian immigrant parents, who both worked as janitors in Brooklyn.</li>
            <li><strong>'90s</strong> - Learned about stocks as a child, from a neighbor named Marty who would play chess with him.</li>
            <li><strong>'97</strong> - Shkreli continued to buy stocks as a teen, collecting shares of Amazon when it went public.</li>
            <li><strong>'99</strong> - Shkreli started working on Wall Street at age 16, after dropping out of high school. He landed an internship with Cramer, Berkowitz & Co.</li>
            <li><strong>'00</strong> - Shkreli had his first run-in with the law before he turned 18. He told Cramer's fund to short a biotechnology stock in 2000. As Shkreli predicted, the stock fell, and Cramer's fund profited. The well-timed short triggered a SEC investigation, but the regulator found no proof of wrongdoing on Shkreli's part.</li>
            <li><strong>'04</strong> - Shkreli received a business degree from Baruch College.</li>
            <li><strong>'09</strong> - He opened his first hedge fund, MSMB Capital Management, where he continued shorting biotech stocks.</li>
            <li><strong>'11</strong> - Shkreli founded Retrophin, a pharmaceutical company.</li>
            <li><strong>'14</strong> - Retrophin's board kicked Shkreli out.</li>
            <li><strong>'15</strong> - Shkreli then funneled money from Retrophin to pay off MSMB's debts, and his own, from February to September.</li>
            <li><strong>'15</strong> - Shkreli formed Turing Pharmaceuticals and bought the rights to market Daraprim, a toxoplasmosis treatment used by AIDS patients. The drug has no generic alternative. Shkreli hiked the price of the drug from $13 to $750, causing widespread backlash, including from then-presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. He said the company needed to profit from the drug, and said everyone who needed the drug would have access to it.</li>
            <li><strong>'15</strong> - A Washington Post reporter went on a Tinder date with Shkreli. She described herself as being as outraged as everyone else about the drug price hike, but also said she had a surprisingly nice time on the date. Shkreli took her to a Japanese restaurant and ordered a $120 cup of tea, before saying "I'm not really a big tea drinker," when she asked how it was.</li>
            <li><strong>'15</strong> - Shkreli also began to live-stream hours of his life at a time on YouTube, where he defended his actions.</li>
            <li><strong>'17</strong> - Shkreli was found guilty of three counts of securities fraud. He faces up to 20 years in prison, but he remained optimistic, because he was found not guilty on a key charge that he had looted Retrophin to make payments on behalf of his hedge fund. Shkreli had insisted before the trial that he would be found "so innocent" that the jury and prosecutors would have to apologize to him.</li>
        </ul>
